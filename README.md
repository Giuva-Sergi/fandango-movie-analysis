# fandango-movie-analysis

This project is composed by two parts:
* The first part with an introductory analysis (based mostly on summary statistics) about the **Fandango** movie rating sistem and a web scraping of data from various wikipedia pages
* The second part, implementing those dataset we used with the data we scraped, is an analysis to see if there's any correlation among movies' budget and ratings.

My point is, in fact, that **Fandango** mostly bases its approach on evaluating a movie on the economic power of a specific company rather than on the inner quality of the movie itself.
